  title={Coercive Distribution},
  author={Albertus, Michael and Fenner, Sofia and Slater, Dan},
  year={2018},
  publisher={Cambridge University Press}}

Short: Distribution underlying durable autocracy can be both broad and coercive, instead of either broad/contractual or targeted/coercive. As new ruling elites expropriate and redistribute assets, they both weaken expropriated elites' social control and establish state capacities while endengering dependency.
Long:
Distribution under autocracy is often both broad and coercive. Previous work either assumed that broad distribution is contractual---geared towards promoting the legitimacy of the regime---and that coercive distribtuion is targeted. Winning coalition theories assume that distribution positively varies with the portion of the selectorate in the winning coalition, usually a small group, and cannot explain broader distribution. Squeaky wheel approaches assume that broad distribution targets recalcitrant or contentious groups; but if distribution goes beyond plausible squeeky wheels, these explanations fall short. Performance legitimacy theories assume that distribution is a bargain between ruling elites and the population where the regime secures support in exchange for the provision of public goods; such explanations fall short where distributive policies are implemented and popular support falls short. Additionally, distribution may only contribute to the legitimacy of the state, not the regime. Clientelistic/ Punishment regime theories a la Magaloni assume that distribution is targeted to punish segments of the coalition that withhold support, but cannot explain broad distribution.
There is a class of distribution that should be understood as both broad a la performance legitimacy, but also coercive a la punishment regime. Such distribution is coercive because, (1); ruling elites use distribution to undermine the ability of other elites to proffer the material underpinnings of strategies of survival for the population--this works both by expropriating elites in order to distribute and by replacing other elites as sources of service provision, and, (2); ruling elites can use distribution to dominate 'strategies of survival'. Doing so both expands state capacity by establishing state control over the basic necessities which the popuolation depends on, and dependence makes the state seem omniscent. Coercive distribution happens in three phases: Displacement is when elites expropriate competitors. Due to the risks, it usually only happens early on when the regime is split or has not consolidated social bases of power. 2, enmeshment, is when services are extended in order to shape citizens strategies of survival. 3, upkeep, is the investment needed to keep distributive policies going.

AM argue that when proximate factors (e.g. revolution, economic crisis, financial crisis, natural disasters) strengthen insurgent outsider economic elites at the expense of incumbents, one of two things will happen: (i), If the ''structural underpinnings'' of the incumbent regime is strong, i.e. when state capacity is high and institutions for processing conflict are present, then incumbent economic elites will ally with incumbent political elites to institutionalize their privledges under an elite-biased democracy (MNS democracy). (ii), if the structural underpinnings are weak (no conflist-resolving institutions, no state capacity), then incumbent political and economic elites will not be able to organize to protect their privledges, and outsider economic elites will overthrow both and establish a popular democracy.
On the other hand, if no proximate factors which weaken incumbent economic elites are instantiated, then regimes lacking structural underpinnings will become volatile dictatorships because there are no institutions which process conflicts among elites. If structural underpinnings are present, then the dictatorship will be consolidated as incumbent political elites enter into a stable arrangement to keep other elites out.

How to think about:
1. Way of reconciling the minimalist conception of democracy with the NS-OA framework from North et al 2009 -- Elite-biased Democracies are natural state democracies, Popular Democracies are open access order democracies, Consolidated Dictatorships are mature natural state dictatorships, Volatile Dictatorships are basic natural state dictatorships.

  title={Repression After Liberalization: Organizational Embeddedness and Protest Policing in a Hybrid Context},
  author={Berman, Chantal},
  journal={Forthcoming},
  year={2018}}
  CHANGE TO AJPS ONCE OUT

Why do hybrid regimes use repression against some protests but not others? Berman argues that the more embedded into the state the social movement organization (SMO) behind the protest is, the less they are repressed. Event data from local Moroccan newspapers (MECD data) shows that the amount of repression decreased with each degree of embeddedness. Repression is coded as ``none'', ``intimidation'', or ``violent''. CSOs are classified into four groups: ``anti-system'' CSOs who charters do not accept the legitimacy of the political system, those that ``accept state legitimacy'' by not contesting the authority of the state, ``overlapping'' CSOs that have or had overlapping personnel with the state, and ``co-opted'' CSOs that were protected by or cooperated with the state prior to liberalization.

[Egypt in Comparative Perspective]:
Four authoritarian regime types in Arab world: (i), constitutional monarchies w/ high levels of contestation, (ii), non-constititional monarchies w/ low levels of contestation, (iii), hegemonic party regimes w/ high levels of contestation, (iv), single party regimes with low levels of contestation. Elections as distributive mechanism varies across MENA mainly according to level of wealth [lots of wealth means low need to use patronage in distribution], and ready-made institutions available to ruling coalition [ethnic coalition means built in patronage networks, or small elite so no need for them].

Empiricists don't like abstract entities -- but in some fields, such as physics, there's no way around them. Some semantic theories say that expressions can designate not material, but abstract, entities. These may be properties as designated by predicates or propositions as designated by sentences. Empiricists don't like it. They're wrong -- these theories are compatible with empiricism.

Survey experiment in Pakistan that looks at the different ways people imagine a Shari'a-compliant state and how those imaginings map onto support for democratic institutions. They show that people who primarily imagine such a state as one that is just, not-corrupt, and provides services/security are those that support democracy–and that these people are actually the majority in the sample.

Markets are traditionally viewed as promoting, destroying, or bending to morals--virtuous, destructive, or feeble. Much recent thought still falls under those categories, but there is also new work that tries to understand markets as moral projects. For example: that people use markets to moralize in favor of their interests, that markets moralize because of the ideas embedded in the ideas that experts use to understand the economy, and that the different moralizing of markets is tied to battles over where the limits of the market should be.

Dictators who pursue institutional co-optation (establish party or legislature) are more likely to violate physical integrity rights (torture, imprisonment) but less likely to violate civil liberties or empowerment rights becuase institutional co-optation draws opponents out into the open and allows rulers to target individuals instead of pursuing broad measures. In effect dictators trade in greater political openness for increased repression.

Does this confuse the problem of dealing with the general population with that of dealing with the elites.

Politics of authoritarian regimes:

Lesson from democratic transition lit -- especially elite splits -- is that sometimes institutions change the balance of power not vice versa. Problem of transition so intractable because transition happens for so many different reasons; happens for so many different reasons becuase dictatorships are so heterogenous. Heterogenous because the source of autocratic support varies so widely. While some d-ship collapse is not due to elite splits, focus on intra-ruling coalition politics still makes sense---we can speculate that likelyhood of collapse due to mass opposition is affected by elite politics.

Typology [51]: According to who decides about who will rule: if small group of military officers, then military [M]; if single-party, then single-party [S]; if mainly one person decides, then personalist [P]. [\emph{Problems already clear: sp captures how institutions structure leadership selection, military captures institutional origin of leaders, personalist captures concentration of choice.}] Personalist category has priority -- even if military or through party, if selection discretion in hands of one person, then personalist.

Interests according to typology [53]:
Launching organization [LO] interests:
[MLO]: Lots of heterogeneity but overarching theme is ``survival and efficacy of military itself''. Where joining military is a way to get rich, that motive can be imputed to members. Assumes that this is secondary b/c those motives lead to less professional, and therefore less powerful military. Officers decide to join coup if they think lots of others will also join (based on consequences of failed coup and what happens

In a formal model where investors are divided into insiders (party cadres) and outsiders, where insiders share information of expropriation and have the choice to contest in order to recover investments, there is an equilibrium that support high investment since institutionalization begets collective action by insider elites to contest expropriation. The conclusion is that highly institutionalized regimes, e.g. single-party regimes, should attract more investment than other authoritarian regimes and that investment should be higher among insiders vs. outsiders. GK use cross-national data to test their model and find support but their empirical strategy is problematic b/c (i), they proxy outsider investors as foreign investors (FDI) [hard to swallow that foreign investors cannot be insiders in a ruling coalition, i.e. share in expropriation information and that ommitted variables aren't driving results]; (ii), they instrument for low institutionalization with a military regime type dummy variable and the success of this instrument hinges on the assumption that coercion and institutionalization are not complementary. At least in the case of political institutionalization, we know that this is a questionable assumption \citep{frantzkendall-taylor2014}. Additionally, some militaries intervene in politics because of prior economic weakness and the subsequent social distress, which might be driving the results; (iii), Finally, I am not sure that the hypothesis which the regression results ostensibly confirm -- that single-party regimes are more likely to support investment -- follows from their theory. Their theory just tells us that if an organization of elites meets certain criteria -- i.e. shared and exclusive information -- then it will support investment by said elites. But GK do not offer a convincing explanation for why the single-party is more likely to be such an organization rather than the other organizations that autocrats often depend on for power (e.g. military, royal family, social movement, etc.).

  title={Fuck Nuance},
  author={Healy, Kieran},
  journal={Sociological Theory},
  year={2017},
  volume={35},
  pages={118--127},
  publisher={Sage Publications Sage CA: Los Angeles, CA}}

Asking for nuance is bad and comes in *three forms*: the call to suppress theory in favor of description (*fine grain*), the request to add some element of abstract noun that "matters" (*conceptual framework*), and, finnaly, the admonition that the theory capture some way that the world is "more complicated than that" (*connoisseur*). Nuance is bad and there are *three grounds*: Theories are good when they are abstract, and abstraction is taking objects in the world and ignoring, or throwing out, features of these objects. Since finding what we should abstract from and to is hard, we want to be able to cleanly evaluate the abstractions we do have. Just throwing more and more variables into a theory -- what Actually Existing Nuance looks like -- makes it difficult to evaluate the variables we do have and find out if abstraction worked (*principled grounds*). Theories are beautiful because they are interesting in the context that they are communicated, not because they make their purveyors feel that they are part of a sophisticated group with exclusive grasp on the "nuance" of an issue (*aesthetic grounds*). Theories are effective because they communicate a convincing idea about how the world works to other people; making a theory more complex reduces the ability of the theory to communicate that idea.

Contra consensus, the correlation between development and resource heavy economies does not reflect a resource curse, whereby resource extraction hinders institutional and economic development. Instead, controlling for geology shows that less developed states with weaker instituions dedicate more of their capital to resource extraction. Once these institutions are controlled for, the negative association between resource extraction and development dissapears. Weaker states are more likely to develop resource intensive economies because they do not have the institutions to sustain diversified ones and, vs. resource curese lit, weak states do not inhibit IOC or NOC activity (b/c saudi stabilizing flattens time horizon, b/c firms have workarounds, b/c regs in developing work). The weak institutions that inhibit development are fiscal monopolies, crony capitalism, urban bias, and politicized finance. These institutions inhibit real development by denying states an easy-to-tax revenue base. They cannot credibly commit to inclusive property rights and face high transaction costs when taxing the economy. When that is the case, ruling elites will pursue the strategy of granting selective property rights in order to secure support and easy revenue. It is under these conditions that states try to pursue pathological economic strategie such as resource dependence, especially since investors in these sectors are not scared off as they otherwise would be, and the weakness of the state helps them enforce their property rights. But even if resources are developed because of state weakness, they can still help alleviate that condition.

Variation in political and economic development largely reflects the way that elites solve the problem of violence. In Natural States, elites solve the problem by forming a coalition and granting members the exclusive rights to form organizations and access rents -- rent-seeking is the glue that holds this type of order together because tieing rents to membership in the coalition allows violence-wielding elites to credibly commit to the coalition, and hence to peace. The returns to membership in the peaceful coalition include the right to form orgs and access to third-party enforcement within the coalition -- both of these exclusive rights increase rents for members. If access to these rights and benefits was available to all, then there would be no incentive for elites to lay down arms. NS arrangements blur the lines between the social and individual personas of ruling elitesby equating elites with the organizations that they head. In some





How to think about:
1. Is this a major change in North's thinking because of what he thinks about as the necessary pre-condition for credible commitments? In the 1989 paper the stronger party can only make a CC to the weaker party if the weaker party controls 2+ veto points. Now, ruling elites can CC if the arrangement they are committing to provides equilibrium rents.

Property rights which protect investment from rulers' opportunism must not just be established, but also credibly committed to in order for investment to occur. A commitment can be rendered credible either by, (1), a history of prior commitment or by, (2), a set of binding rules forcing rulers to commit. The glorious revolution in 1688 kicked off a process which culminated in evermore binding rules and also yielded the corrosponding increase in commitment via lower borrowing costs.

Do elections affect fiscal policy? What does a theory of the PBC look like for authoritarianism. Elections signal support and make regime legitimate.

Malaysia is a competitive authoritarian regime b/c (i), there are elections, (ii), incumbents do not have the discretion to manipulate or eliminate elections at will. Authoritarian regimes with elections range from competetive authoritarian, where elections involve competition, to non-competitive authoritarian, where they do not. As authoritarian regimes become more competetive, they are more likely to have a PBC like Malaysia.

Why? First, if the point of elections are intimidating the opposition, why not just lie about the results instead of using the PBC? First, because lying successfully gets harder as (i), more citizens have access to the media, (ii), the press has more freedom, and, (iii), citizens have more civic awareness. It follows that as the authoritarianism gets more competetive, incentives to economically manipulate vote-casting win out over incentives to politically manipulate vote-counting and vote result-claims. Second, the possibility of a public outcry -- even if minimal -- is higher if votes are manipulated post-election---and that might be reason enough to choose pre-election PBCs. So, if both conditions are met, we expect incumbents to use PBCs more often. The paper does not test if the effects of elections on government spending in Malaysia are conditional on the degree of competitive-ness of the regime---instead it takes Malaysia to be a paradigmatic case of a competitive regime and tries to establish causality.

Lit review:
Gandhi and Przeworski [2001]: elections are a show of strength, intimidating the opposition.
Hermet [1978]: elections legitimate
Lawson [1993; 196]: leadership believes that elections will help reduce ``pressure''

Causality:
Regression can't say anything about causality b/c third factor -- say, the need to establish legitimacy -- may be behind both the choice to call elections and the choice to juice social spending. But there is a difference between what we should observe if the theory is correct -- spending before elections, but not after -- vs. what we should see if the ommitted variable story is correct -- spending around elections, both before and after. Models 4 /& 5 support this. Another alternative source of endogeneity -- that both elections and spending are more likely if leadership expects poor future economic performance. But if this were true, then extra spending should continue independent of elections---since it is targeting a downturn that the elections themselves cannot prevent.

Why accept the outcome of a vote? It cannot be because we participated --- there are no a priori grounds to infer compliance from participation. Instead, elections generate information about the distribution of power; voters telegraph the outcome of potential conflict to incumbents. Losers know that abdicating the de jure measurement of power as a selection mechanism in favor of a de facto mechanism puts them at a disadvantage---because they are not liked. So, why do elections generate compliance? Losing exposes weakness, knowledge of weakness induces compliance.

The correlation holds for most measures of government spending, in low‐as well as high‐income samples, and is robust to the inclusion of a wide range of controls. One explanation is that government spending plays a risk‐reducing role in economies exposed to a significant amount of external risk. The Paper provides a range of evidence consistent with this hypothesis. In particular, the relationship between openness and government size is strongest when terms‐of‐trade risk is highest. }}

partisan control, cross issue coalition, policy delegation. Partisan control matters because the presence of veto points doesn't or wouldn't  matter when no one on the recieving end of a purported credible commitment actually controls said veto point, i.e. in France. Cross issue coalitions matter because political minority groups, i.e. financiers in England, can still control a veto point if they are part of a cross issue coalition. Policy delegation matters because bureaucratic delegation only improves credibility if coalition for delegation controls a veto point, but also makes it possible to do so with just one, instead of multiple, veto points.

For Stasavage's example, the likelyhood of government default, the restrictions which render credible commitment rational are demanding; if time horizons are short or if creditors are largely international, the likelyhood of default is rather high. Furthermore, exogenous shocks mean that sometimes default can sometimes only be avoided if the different veto players agree on policy. The conclusion is that while more veto points should, on average, increase credibility multiple veto points do not constitute a sufficient condition for credibility nor a necessary condition. Bureaucratic delegation, on the other hand, can shift the reversion point in favor of creditors since it means that multiple veto points do not need to agree on policy, just one might be enough.

  journal = 	 {Annual Review of Sociology},
  year = 	 1997,
  volume = 	 23}}

The old institutionalism pays attention to how successful institutions, those that actually regulate organizations, are staffed. The way staff is trained, motivated, and governed is taken as central to any account of succesful institutional action. Instituions had to be ran by 'organizing acitivities on their behalf'. By contrast, the new institutionalism assumes that institutions constrain without accounting for specific people enforcing the rules. Institutions under the new institutionalism are 'collective representations' that operate on their own. Only the old institutionalism helps understand institutional legitimacy by showing \emph{'how the legitimacy of rituals depends on substantive good sense applied to questions of value'}. Credible commitment is only possible if people believe that institutional enforcers themselves believe in the value of the institutions. Several problems in modern economic sociology can be better understood in light of the old institutonalism: 1, how institutions like courts regulate the different parties in the legal process to produce evidence considered legitimate; 2, how institutions of contract can be legitimate, convincing partners of exchange that the other partner will continue to provde the same quality of service; 3, how the institution of the market system as a whole allow successful claims on the profits yielded by competence---in short, why is competition legitimate; 4, how institutions can fail to provide the public goods taken as antecedent conditions of economic developemnt.
1
Officially, the purpose of court is to follow institutional rules: the supreme court makes the institutional rules and other judges and courts should only be applying those standards when they make decisions. According to the new institutionalism, formalities of evidence law not laid out in those standards are just a ritual to legitimate the application of the standards. But, if that is the case, there is no reason for courts go to the trouble of writing opinions and for parties to appeal. If judges and lower courts are just applying standards of the supreme court and going through rituals, why shouldn't that ritual just be deciding, without justification, that the standards of the supreme court yield a decision. We can only understand the process of opinion writing, appeal, and evidence handling in light of our mutual expectation that 'justice' will be served by a court judgement. The institution is not legitimate in virtue of adherance institutional rules, it is legitimate because there is a collective belief about what those staffing the institution intend when they apply those rules. The content of the institutional rituals is not empty; justifying decisions in opinions establishes that the institutional rules are applied with an intention: serving justice. 'Formality is not enough for legitimacy'. The upshot is that beliefs about what the institutions should do and actually does can explain how well the institution constrains. Ritualization and formalization will increase with the substantive importance of the issues at stake because important issues demand that the values of the institution are justified.
2
Values that guarantee future performance by contracting partners constitute successful markets. The coase theorem states that the maximizing boundry of the firm should cleave to the distinction between what it can do cheaper/better itself vs. hire out. It follows that a belief in the future competence of the contracting partner is a necessary condition od contracting that is itself noncontractual. Transacting only makes sense if there are contracting partners who make credible, often moral, commitments to be the best at what they are contracted to do. But the ability of firms to make such commitments will vary.
3
The form of competition between organizations changes depending on citizens' value commitments. Schumpeter wanted to know, what institutions permit the destruction of 'whole populations of organization' entailed by market competition? How can it be that the organizations washed out by creative destruction, which often support jobs, industrie, and communities, are less legitimate than the institutions which permit those organizations to fail? Schumpeter thought that the balance between the organizations threatened by competitition and the institutions that permit competititon was precarious.
What institutions are they? Commons thought that those institutions were the rules preventing others from interfering in the property rights and decisions of firms; even shareholders cannot individually take away the wages of a worker etc. These 'working rules' of the firm constitute its autonomy to make its own rules, and therefore to compete. The existence of such autonomy, and the institutions that guarantee it are, in the longee duree, new. Competition has usually not been legitimate.

Banfield: institutions that prevent public goods from being distributed with integrity undermine capitalism. The nuclear family is such an institutions if action in its interests ride roughshod over public interests---e.g. in southern italy.

Two distinctive features of autocracy shape politics under such regimes: endemic violence and the absence of a third party enforcement. Autocratic interests -- and the policies that autocrats pursue -- are a response to two problems: \emph{control} -- keeping coalition elites in line -- and \emph{powersharing} -- keeping the population in line.

Two solutions to the powersharing problem exist. Either the dictator usurps all power from the ruling coalition -- \emph{established autocracy} -- or the dictator shares power -- \emph{contested autocracy}. While allies want to credibly threat rebellion if the dictator tries to take their power, if the balance of power is already so far in the dictator's favor that any rebellion is likely to fail, such threats are not credible ex-ante. More seriously, allies often don't know if the dictator is trying to consolidate power. Here institutions matter: when dictators govern through institutions that publicize the balance of power\footnote{This is a very \citet{przeworski1991} idea --- that institutions help manage conflict by revealing who has power. But in Przeworski's story, revealing the balance of power may help prevent power grabs but is not sufficient to guarantee stability because contracting everything is impossible and residual power accrues to one party in the bargaining relationship. What about autocratic institutions---do any of them help randomize the allocation of residual power from contracting?}, allies will notice if they do not have power to make decisions.

But if there are no formal rules that govern the exersize of power, then dictators usurp allies by making informal deals -- buying the loyalty -- of officials instead of replacing them. Informal deals are harder to observe. These two factors -- risk of failure and imperfect info -- undermine the ex-post credibility of elites' threats. Even if success is likely, elites don't want to pay the cost of making it happen unless close to certain. But since they often don't know for certain if the dictator is usurping power, they don't know if rebellion is worth it. By the same token, the dictator is incentivized to scheme because she knows elites might not catch on.

This dynamic helps us make sense of arbitrary firings, personal attacks, etc. They signal to allies that the dictator doesn't depend on his administrators, that no there is no administrator that can't be replaced.

  title={Contracting on violence: The moral hazard in authoritarian repression and military intervention in politics},
  author={Svolik, Milan W},

  volume={57},

  year={2013},

Why do those with guns obey those without them? Ruling elites that confront organized, potentially violent, mass unrest depend on the military to repress. But reliance makes military leadership ``understand'' (signal or accurately reflects?) their power and  demand concessions. When bargaining over concessions breaks down, the military uses force to get its way. Hence, choosing repression risks intervention. But the relationship is not monotonic: the military is more likely at medium threat levels because they have enough resources to intervene, but not enough to convince ruling elites to credibly commit to the bargains. Threat levels are proxied by inequality.

Credible commitment is hard b/c the RE has good reason to think that M won't punish it for cheating and, therefore, M has good reason to think that RE might cheat. Why? Since the military has difficulty of knowing if gov is complying with any agreement struck upon intervention (b/c politically inexperienced, etc.), and since intervention might fail or split the military, there are good reasons for M not to intervene. Hence, RE has reasons to think it can get away wiht not honoring commitments.

Thesis in other words: Svolik thinks that civilians are more likely to lose control of the military in case of an intermediate level of threat from society because (i), societal threats require repression and repression requires the military; (ii); requiring a little military means the RE might not give the military what it wants but the military doesn't have the power to take it, requiring a little more military means the RE won't give the military what it wants but the military has the power to take it,  requiring a lot of military means the RE will give the military what it wants.

Qs: Does it de facto increase military power or just signal their power to the leadership, or just increase the signal to noise ratio fo thier power?
What concessions does the military want?
Does the proxy for threat level work? Does inequality really predict uprising? Is all the work relying on Boix and AR wise?

Notes: While Svolik wants to know what happens if ruling elites depend on a military with independent political goals to repress organized and potentially violent opposition, I want to know what happens when ruling elites depend on a military to repress opposition that might be balanced out by other opposition groups instead.
Is a problem with my model that it has nothing to say about when a military might come to power?
Need to read Geddes 2009 on balancing.

Large study of Chinese firms' political connections. Finds that firms are very connected (90 percent of firms), that firms are more connected to government than to parliament, and that connections to national government have increased more than connections to local government (by 300 perent vs. 30). Interpretation of the last point: local connections are more unstable because local officials get switched out more often and are more likely to be targeted by anti-corruption campaigns -- hence political connections at upper levels of government become more robust with respect to political hazard. When one Shanghai party chief was removed, companies that were only connected to local government lost value on the stock market, (while others did not?).

While realists do not have an account of ''approximate truth'' or ''maturity'' that can cash out the ''no miracles'' argument in light of revolutionary theory change from one successful theory to another successful yet ontologically distinct theory -- i.e. easy target practice for \citet{laudan1981}. These problems can be avoided if we try to understand why science is empirically cumulative, without claiming that it is theoretically/ontologically contininous. We can do this by pointing at the structures of a successfull theory, i.e. the equations, which get preserved from one theory to the next or still serve as limiting cases. Even if all the ontological furniture of the old theory gets junked during the transition, often the structures which account for prior empirical success stick around. We should be realists about these structures.

(1)
Personalist/Monarchichal regimes (PM) are associated with dependence on natural resource revenue relative to domestic investment. Converse is true for Single-Party/Military regimes (SM). Hence, the incentives for establishing binding legislatures (BL) under SM > under PM.
(2)
Under SM, P(L) is associated w/ a more productive economy, less oil revenue, and longer time horizons.
Under PM, P(notL) is associated w/a more productive economy, less oil revenue, and longer time horizons.
(3)
P(Growth given L & SM) > P(growth given notL & SM).
P(Growth given L and PM) < P(Growth given notL & PM)

The causal story is that rentierism, proxied by relative dependence on natural resources(NR) vs. domestic investment (DI), causes PM regimes. And that the economic strategy of each regime gives the incentive structure for the ruler: Sounder  High NR, Low DI, and therefore PM, conditions the ruler has little reason to establish BL.


If the second part of 3 is true, why do SMs have Ls?
