# The top of any Rmd document is the header, written with YAML.
# We are controlling global settings for the way the document is built.

# Comments in YAML are like comments in R, the pound sign `#`



# Supply VALUES to VARIABLES.
# By default, values don't need to be quoted.
title: In-Depth R Markdown

# If the value contains a special character (in this case, a colon)
#   you may want to put the value in quotes

  This document serves as lecture notes for R Markdown (March 27, 2020). It demonstrates key capabilities of R Markdown for preparing HTML documents and PDF documents: incorporating R code along with Markdown writing, controlling the output of R code, writing math, creating tables and figures, bibliographies, rendering to multiple output formats, and more.

# Many Rmd options are "global"
# i.e. they don't depend on output type.
geometry: margin = 1.15in              # margin widths
fontsize: 12pt                         # text size
bibliography: "~/bibliography1.bib" # bibliography file
biblio-style: authoryear              # citation style
urlcolor: blue                         # links to external URLs
citecolor: black                       # links to bibliography
linkcolor: magenta                     # internal figures, footnotes, etc.
indent: false                          # paragraph format
                                       # (true for indented paragraphs)

# While other Rmd options are output-specific,
#   which can be modified as "sub-options" 
#   tracked by this indentation setup.
